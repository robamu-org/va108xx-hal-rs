/// Marker trait for type identity
///
/// This trait is used as part of the [`AnyKind`] trait pattern. It represents
/// the concept of type identity, because all implementors have
/// `<Self as Is>::Type == Self`. When used as a trait bound with a specific
/// type, it guarantees that the corresponding type parameter is exactly the
/// specific type. Stated differently, it guarantees that `T == Specific` in
/// the following example.
///
/// ```
/// where T: Is<Type = Specific>
/// ```
///
/// Moreover, the super traits guarantee that any instance of or reference to a
/// type `T` can be converted into the `Specific` type.
///
/// ```
/// fn example<T>(mut any: T)
/// where
///     T: Is<Type = Specific>,
/// {
///     let specific_mut: &mut Specific = any.as_mut();
///     let specific_ref: &Specific = any.as_ref();
///     let specific: Specific = any.into();
/// }
/// ```
